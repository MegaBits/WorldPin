# SIOSocket

## How to use

SIOSocket can be added as a CocodaPod, submodule, or standalone dependency to any iOS 7.0 (or greater) project.

```objc
#import <SIOSocket/SIOSocket.h>

// ...
[SIOSocket socketWithHost: @"http://localhost:3000" response: ^(SIOSocket *socket)
{
    self.socket = socket;
}];
```

## Generators

#### + (void)socketWithHost:response:

Generates a new `SIOSocket` object, begins its connection to the given host, and returns it as the sole parameter of the response block.

The host reachable at the given URL string should be running a valid instance of a socket.io server.

#### + (void)socketWithHost:reconnectAutomatically:attemptLimit:withDelay:maximumDelay:timeout:response:

- `reconnectAutomatically` whether to reconnect automatically (`YES`)
- `attemptLimit` number of times to attempt a reconnect (Infinite)
- `reconnectionDelay` how long to wait before attempting a new
reconnection (`1`)
- `maximumDelay` maximum amount of time to wait between
reconnections (`5`). Each attempt increases the reconnection by
the amount specified by `reconnectionDelay`.
- `timeout` connection timeout before an `onReconnectionError` event is emitted (`20`)
